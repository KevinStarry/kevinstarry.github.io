            <p>the most overlooked, under-rated sign of a great relationship</p>
<p>&ldquo;i love you - i am at rest with you - i have come home.&rdquo; - Dorothy L.Sayers</p>
<p>relationships are hard,everyone says.<br>
and they seem paricularly hard when you&rsquo;re going through a rough patch with your partner or you&rsquo;ve had your heart torn to shreds.</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s true that all relationships have their challenges it&rsquo;s can skew your thinking; it can make you think that being in a relationship is harder than ricing bear grylls up a mountain.</p>
<p>but a young man i worked with reminded me of this sign of a great relationship - which is often overlooked and definitely under-rated.</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s his story&hellip; <br>
when we met, he was 30 and had just come out of a torrid relationship; his girlfriend had been needy, manipulative and impossible to read: he never knew what version of her he was going to get.</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d finally broken away but it had letf him anxious, almost traumatised. and it was not the first time - all his realtionships had been hard: unpredictable and confusing.</p>
<p>he was up for giving up, of filing women in the &lsquo;too hard&rsquo; basket and just hanging out with his mates. and he did - for nearly two years.</p>
<p>but then he met someone. when we caught up again, they&rsquo;d been together six months and he was still shaking his head at his luck in finding her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;what&rsquo;s so differnet about this relationship?&rdquo; i asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s just so easy,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>the magic of an easy relationship</p>
<p>&ldquo;have enough courage to trust love one more time and always one more time.&rdquo; - maya angelou</p>
<p>my client made a great point. having an &ldquo;easy&rdquo; realationship is frequently under-rated because it might not seem edgy or sparky enough. and relationship are supposed to be hard&hellip; aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>nope. ralatinship do take effort - you can&rsquo;t afford to be lazy or complacent with them. and every relationship faces tests over time. but you shouldn&rsquo;t wake up every day feeling like it&rsquo;s all &ldquo;hard slog&rdquo;, like you&rsquo;re going to work on a construction site(even if you are).</p>
<p>but some of the best relationship work(and keep working) because of the ease both partners feel in the others' company. here are the key signs you might be onto a very good &ldquo;easy&rdquo; thing.</p>
<p>8 signs of an easy relationship</p>
<ol>
<li>you feel okay about yourself - consistently.</li>
</ol>
<p>your partner likes you - the whole package - and tells you so, often. you like who you are when you&rsquo;re with you partner. which teaches you to like youself more when you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>you feel safe - physically, sexually and emotionnaly.</li>
</ol>
<p>obviously, feeling safe with a partner is critical. but you also feel safe to raise the &ldquo;big&rdquo; topics - tha your partner will listen and their reactions will be fair and reasonable, even if they don&rsquo;t always agree with you.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>you can not-talk for hours.</li>
</ol>
<p>you&rsquo;re as comfortable in silence as you are with talking. it means you feel fully relaxed around them. which is a wonderful thing.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>you know who&rsquo;s walking through the door.</li>
</ol>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to  wait nervously to see which version of your partner has shown up for your anxiety to settle. so you&rsquo;re always happy to see them before they show up - as well as when they do.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>you sort out disagreements quickly.</li>
</ol>
<p>you both own your mistakes and apologise appropriately when necessary. you don&rsquo;t hold grudges or storm out of the hourse or give silent treatment or use sex as a weapon or any other dysfunctional &ldquo;battle&rdquo; strategies.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>your partner encourages you to see your friends.</li>
</ol>
<p>wow. your partner wants you to have a life beyond them. it makes you want them to have one too.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>you like hanging out together</li>
</ol>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to spend every weaking minute together but, because you genuinely enjoy your partner&rsquo;s company, you create time for it. you both initiate things for the two of you to do and, shock-horror, you have fun.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>it just feels good.</li>
</ol>
<p>you struggle to put it into words but it just feels good. as helen keller said:&ldquo;the best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even heard, but must be felt with heart.&rdquo; it feels&hellip;right.</p>
